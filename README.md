# Sentiment Project Backend
This repository holds all of the code needed by the virtual machine to:
1. Score conference calls
2. Summarize data
3. Upload data to cloud datastore. 

Please note that most of this code has been developed by others and only was cleaned up by me and consolidated into a single repository to improve the ease of cloning data into the virtual machine.
